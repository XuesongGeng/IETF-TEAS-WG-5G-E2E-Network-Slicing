     IETF Network Slice Application in 5G End-to-End Network Slice
            draft-gcdrb-teas-5g-network-slice-application-00

Abstract

   Network Slicing is one of the core features in 5G, which provides
   different network service as independent logical networks.  To
   provide 5G network slices service, an end-to-end network slice needs
   to consists of 3 major types of network segments: Radio Access
   Network (RAN), Mobile Core Network (CN) and Transport Network (TN).
   This document describes the application of IETF network slice in
   providing 5G end-to-end network slices, including the network slice
   identification mapping, network slice parameter mapping and 5G IETF
   Network Slice NBI.

1.  Introduction

   Driven by the new applications of 5G, the concept of network slicing
   is defined to provide a logical network with specific capabilities
   and characteristics.  Network slice contains a set of network
   functions and allocated resources(e.g. computation, storage and
   network resources).

   The IETF Network Slice (NS) service is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] as a set of connections between a
   number of CEs, with that connections having specific Service Level
   Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common
   underlay network, with the traffic of one customer being separated
   from another.  The concept of IETF network slice is conceived as
   technology agnostic.

   The IETF NS service is specified in terms of the set of endpoints
   (from CE perspective) connected to the slice, the type of
   connectivity among them, and a set of SLOs and SLEs for each
   connectivity construct.

   In [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang], the endpoints are
   described by an identifier, with some metrics associated to the
   connections among them as well as certain policies (e.g., rate limits
   for incoming and outgoing traffic).

   The 5G network slice as defined in [3GPP TS 23.501] does not take the
   transport network slice into consideration.  This document introduces
   the concept of 5G end-to-end network slice, which is composed of
   three major types network segments: Radio Access Network (RAN),
   Transport Network (TN) and Mobile Core Network (CN).  Transport
   network is supposed to provide the required connectivity between AN
   and CN or inside AN/CN, with specific performance commitment.  For
   each end-to-end network slice, the topology and performance
   requirement for transport network can be very different, which
   requests transport network to have the capability of supporting
   multiple different transport network slices.

2.  Terminologies

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terminologies for IETF Network Slice go along with the definition in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   The following terms are used in this document:

3.  5G End-to-End Network Slice

   The scope of 5G End-to-End Network Slice discussed in this document
   is shown in figure 1.  Transport network provides connectivity
   between and inside RAN and CN.  To support fully automated enablement
   and assurance of 5G E2E network slices, multiple controllers are
   needed to manage 5G E2E network slices in RAN, Core and Transport
   domains.  In addition, an E2E network slice orchestrator is needed to
   provide coordination and control of network slices from an E2E
   perspective.

           Figure-1 Scope of 5G End to End Network Slice

   Depend on the RAN technology deployment, the 5G IETF network slices
   are sets of connections between network functions and mobile
   applications:

   o  IETF Network Slices in Distributed RAN deployment

   Distributed RAN is the most common deployment of 4G and 5G RAN
   networks as shown in Figure 2-1.  The RAN network is connected to
   Core network (CN) using the IETF transport network (TN).

   In this case, a single E2E network slice contains not only RAN and
   Core slices but IETF network slices INS_1 which provides the
   connectivity between RAN to CN slices.

   o  IETF Network Slices in Centralized RAN deployment

   The RAN consists of two functional units: the baseband unit and the
   radio unit (RU).  The baseband unit processes the radio signal and is
   connected to the transport network.  The RU transmits and receives
   the carrier signal that is transmitted over the air to the end user
   equipment (UE).  In Centralized RAN as depicted in Figure 2-2, the RU
   and baseband are separated by a network called fronthaul network.

   In this deployment a single 5G E2E network slice contains not only 5G
   RAN and 5G Core slices but one IETF network slice INS_1 where INS_1
   is identical to their counterparts in distributed RAN deployment
   case.

   o  5G IETF Network Slices in Cloud RAN (C-RAN)

   In Cloud-RAN deployment, the baseband unit is further disaggregated
   into real-time and non-real-time components.  The former is deployed
   close to antenna to manages the real-time air interface resources
   while the non-real-time control functions are hosted centrally in the
   cloud.  These components are called CU (Central Unit) and DU
   (Distributed Unit) as shown in Figure 2-3 where these entities are
   connected by a new network called Midhaul network.

   In this deployment a single E2E network slice contains not only RAN
   and 5G Core slices but IETF network slices INS_1 and INS_2 where
   INS_1 is identical to their counterparts in centralized RAN
   deployment case (see Figure 2-2) and a new IETF network slice INS_2
   connects the DUs to CUs through F1 interface.

   Figure-3 Correspondence between 5G E2E Slices and IETF Slices

   An example of 5G E2E Network Slice is showed in figure 4.  Each e2e
   network slice contains AN slice, CN slice and one or more IETF
   network Slices. 3GPP identifies each e2e network slice using an
   integer called S-NSSAI.  In Figure 4 there are three instances of e2e
   network slices which are identified by S-NSSAI 01111111, 02222222 and
   02333333, respectively.  Each instance of e2e network slice contains
   AN slice, CN Slice and one or more IETF network slices.  For example,
   e2e network slice 01111111 has AN Slice instance 4, CN Slice instance
   1 and IETF network slice 6.  Note that 3GPP does not cover the IETF
   network slice.  See [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] for details
   of IETF network slice.

   Note that 3GPP uses the terms NSI and NSSI which are a set of network
   function and required resources (e.g. compute, storage and networking
   resources) which corresponds to network slice Instance, whereas
   S-NSSAI is an integer that identifies the e2e network slice.

   Figure 4 5G End-to-End Network Slice and its components

   The following network slice related identifiers in management plane,
   control plane and data(user) plane play an important role in end-to-
   end network slice mapping:

   o  Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information(S-NSSAI):
      The end-to-end network slice identifier, which is defined in
      [TS23501]; S-NSSAI is used during 3GPP network slice signalling
      process.

   o  IETF Network Slice Identifier: An identifier allocated by IETF
      Neetwork Slice Controller (NSC) in management plane.  In data
      plane, IETF Network Slice Identifier may be instantiated with
      existing data plane identifiers and doesn't necessarily require
      new encapsulation.

   o  IETF Network Slice Interworking Identifier: Data-plane network
      slice identifier which is used for mapping the end-to-end network
      slice traffic to specific IETF network slice.  The IETF Network
      Slice Interworking Identifier is a new concept introduced by this
      draft, which may be instantiated with existing data plane
      identifiers and doesn't necessarily require new encapsulation.

   The relationship between these identifiers are specifies in the
   following sections.

4.  3GPP Network Slice Mapping Parameters

   The network slice concept was introduced in 3GPP specifications from
   the first 5G release, corresponding to Release 15.  As captured in
   [TS23.501], a network slice represents a logical network providing
   specific network capabilities and network characteristics.  In
   Information Object Class NetworkSliceSubnet [TS28.541 Clause 6.3.2],
   the attribute TransportRef per 3GPP interfaces F1-U and NgU/N3 is
   used to specify a list of EP_Transport Information Object Class (IOC)
   instance(s) associated with these interfaces in per logical link
   fashion.

   Information Object Class EP_Transport [TS28.541 Clause 6.3.18]
   represents logical interface parameters of 3GPP subsystems, providing
   specific network capabilities and network characteristics.
   Relationships of Transport slicing-related 3GPP IOCs and IETF domain
   represented on the Figure X for NgU/N3 slices with traffic between
   3GPP CU-UP (or ORAN) CU-UP and 3GPP UPF, while the Figure Y similarly
   represents F1-U slices with traffic between 3GPP (or ORAN) DU and
   3GPP (or ORAN) CU-UP .

   Figure 5-2 Slicing example on the F1-U interface

   To make slicing a reality, every technical domain is split into one
   or more logical network partitions, each referred to as a network
   slice subnet.  The definition of multiple slice subnets on a single
   domain allows each segment to provide differentiated behaviors, in
   terms of functionality and/or performance, tailored to some specific
   needs.  The stitching of slice subnets across the RAN, CN and TN
   results in the definition of 5G network slices in 3GPP.

   From a management viewpoint, the concept of network slice subnet
   represents an independently manageable yet composable portion of a
   network slice.  The rules for the definition of network slice subnets
   and their composition into network slices are detailed in the 5G
   Network Resource Model (NRM) [TS28.541], specifically in the Network
   Slice NRM fragment.  This fragment captures the information model of

   5G network slicing, which specifies the relationships between
   different slicing related managed entities, each represented as a
   separate Information Object Class (IOC).  An IOC captures the
   semantics and attributes of a manageable entity; in other words, it
   defines the class based on which instances (objects) from this entity
   can be created.  In the model, four different IOCs are cosnidered:

   o  NetworkSlice IOC, representing a network slice.  This IOC is
      associated with one or more ServiceProfiles, each representing the
      requirements of a particular service.  The 1:N relationship of
      NetworkSlice IOC with the ServiceProfile is because one network
      slice can host multiple services, as long as they do not impose
      conflicting requirements.

   o  NetworkSliceSubnet IOC, associated with a network slice subnet.
      This IOC is associated with one or more SliceProfiles.

   o  ManagedFunction IOC, which represents a 5G network function.

   o  EP_Transport IOC, which represents an interface associated with
      transport network level information, e.g., transport address,
      reachability information, and QoS profiles.

   For the transport (i.e., connectivity) related part of a network
   slice, the key focus is on the EP_Transport IOC.  Instances of this
   IOC serves to instantiate 3GPP interfaces (e.g., N3) which are needed
   to support Network Slicing and to define Network Slice transport
   resources within the 5G NRM.  In a nutshell, the EP_Transport IOC
   permits to define additional logical interfaces for each slice
   instance of the 3GPP user plane.

   According to [TS28.541], the EP_Transport construct on 3GPP side has
   the following attributes:

   o  ipAddress (mandatory): specifies the IP address assigned to the
      logical transport interface.  It is used for transport routing.
      Assigned uniquely per slice.  As per [TS28.541] IP address is
      defined as an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.  The concern is
      that for the coherent networking, IP address should be assigned to
      the interface with a network mask, to form an IPv4 or IPv6 prefix.

   o  logicInterfaceInfo (mandatory): a set of parameters, which
      includes logicInterfaceType and logicInterfaceId.  It specifies
      the type and identifier of a logical interface.  It could be a
      VLAN ID, MPLS Tag or Segment ID.  This is assigned uniquely per
      slice.

Internet-Dradraft-gcdrb-teas-5g-network-slice-application-00   July 2022


   o  nextHopInfo (optional): identifies the ingress transport node.
      Each node can be identified by any combination of IP address of
      next-hop router of transport network, system name, port name and
      IP management addresses of transport nodes.

   o  qosProfile (optional): specifies the set of QoS parameters which
      are logically provisioned on both sides on a logical transport
      interface.  This is assigned uniquely per slice.

   o  epApplicationRef (mandatory): specifies the list of application
      endpoints associated with the logical transport interface.  A
      multiplicity of them may be assigned per slice.  This attribute is
      used to maintain association with corresponding 3GPP logical
      interface (NgU (N3), F1_U), to which EP_Transport is related to.
      Notice that one EP_Transport (representing a logical transport
      interface) can be associated with more than one multiple
      EP_Application (representing an application endpoint of a 3GPP
      managed function), but also the other way around.  While the first
      case captures the typical situation, the second case can be used
      for the sake of resilience or load balance in the transport
      network.

   From the Transport Network domain side, these parameters assist on
   the definition of the CE transport interface configuration and shall
   be taken as an input to the transport service model to create
   coherent Network Slice transport service.  Fig. Z illustrates how the
   EP_Transport parameters can relate to the IETF ones for determining
   the endpoint connectivity.

   Furthermore, that same parameters should be leveraged for
   constituting the connectivity construct allowing endpoint
   interconnection.  That is, there is no additional information that
   could be leveraged at service level that the one provided by

      Figure 5-6: EP_Transport parameters map to IETF Slice realizations

   From the perspective of IETF Network Slice realization, some of these
   options could be realized in a straightforward manner while other
   could require of advanced features (e.g., PBR, SRv6, FlexE, etc).

   IETF Network Slice service may be a set of techniques and underlaying
   technologies, so multiple models may be used to define slice.

Figure-6 Relation between IETF and 3GPP Network Slice management

   1.  NSMF receives the request from CSMF for allocation of a network
   slice instance with certain characteristics.

   2.  Based on the service requirement , NSMF acquires requirements for
   the end-to-end network slice instance , which is defined in Service
   Profile([TS28541] section 6.3.3).

   3.  Based on Service Profile, NSMF identified the network function
   and the required resources in AN, CN and TN networks.  It also
   assigns the unique ID S-NSSAI.

   4.  NSMF sends a request to AN NSSMF for creation of AN Slice.

   5.  NSMF sends a request to CN NSSMF for creation of CN Slice.

   6.  NSMF sends a request to IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) for
   creation of IETF Network Slice.  The request contains such attribute
   such as endpoints, required SLA/SLO along with other IETF network
   slice attributes.  It also cotains mapping informatin for IETF
   Network Slice Interworking Identifier.

Internet-Dradraft-gcdrb-teas-5g-network-slice-application-00   July 2022


   7.  NSC realizes the IETF network slice which satisfies the
   requirement of IETF network slice between the specified endpoints
   (RAN/ CN edge nodes).  It assigns sliceID and send it to NSMF.

   8.  NSMF has the mapping relationship between S-NSSAI and IETF
   Network Slice ID;

   9.  When the User Equipment (UE) appears, and during the 5G
   signalling, it requests to be connected to specific e2e network slice
   identified by S-NASSI.  Then a GTP tunnel (which is UDP/IP) will be
   created.

   10.  UE starts sending traffic in context of e2e network slice for
   specific S-NASSI.

   11.  In context of GTP tunnel, the AN edge nodes encapsulates the
   packet with sliceIID according to the selected S-NSSAI ans send it to
   the transport network.

   12.  The transport network edge node receives the IP packet and
   parses the sliceIID from the packet and maps the packet to the
   corresponding IETF network slice.  It may encapsulate packet with
   sliceID if needed (for example for enforcing QoS in transport
   network).

5.1.  5G E2E Network Slice Mapping in Management Plane

   The transport network management Plane maintains the interface
   between NSMF and TN NSSMF, which 1) guarantees that IETF network
   slice could connect the AN and CN with specified characteristics that
   satisfy the requirements of communication; 2) builds up the mapping
   relationship between NSI identifier and TN NSSI identifier; 3)
   maintains the end-to-end slice relevant functions;

   Service Profile defined in[TS28541] represents the requirement of
   end-to-end network slice instance in 5G network.  Parameters defined
   in Service Profile include Latency, resource sharing level,
   availability and so on.  How to decompose the end-to-end requirement
   to the transport network requirement is one of the key issues in
   Network slice requirement mapping.  GSMA(Global System for Mobile
   Communications Association) defines the [GST] to indicate the network
   slice requirement from the view of service provider.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] analysis the parameters
   of GST and categorize the parameters into three classes, including
   the attributes with direct impact on the IETF network slice
   definition.  It is a good start for selecting the transport network
   relevant parameters in order to define Network Slice Profile for
   Transport Network.  Network slice requirement parameters are also

   necessary for the definition of transport network northbound
   interface.

   Inside the TN NSSMF, it is supposed to maintain the attributes of the
   IETF network slice.  If the attributes of an existing TN NSSI could
   satisfy the requirement from TN Network Slice Profile, the existing
   TN NSSI could be selected and the mapping is finished If there is no
   existing TN NSSI which could satisfy the requirement, a new TN NSSI
   is supposed to be created by the NSSMF with new attributes.

   TN NSSI resource reservation should be considered to avoid over
   allocation from multiple requests from NSMF (but the detailed
   mechanism should be out of scope in the draft)

   TN NSSMF sends the selected or newly allocated TN NSSI identifier to
   NSMF.  The mapping relationship between NSI identifier and TN NSSI
   identifier is maintained in both NSMF and TN NSSMF.

   YANG data model for the Transport Slice NBI, which could be used by a
   higher level system which is the Transport slice consumer of a
   Transport Slice Controller (TSC) to request, configure, and manage
   the components of a transport slices.  The northbound Interface of
   IETF network slice refers to
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang].

   At the time of provisioning a 3GPP slice, it is required to provide
   slice connectivity constructs by means of IETF network slices.  Then
   it is necessary to bind two different endpoints, as depicted in
   Figure 2:

   o  Mapping of EP_Transport (as defined by [TS28.541]) to the endpoint
      at the CE side o f the IETF network slice.  This is necessary
      because the IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) will receive as
      input for the IETF network slice service the set of endpoints at
      CE side to be interconnected

   o  Mapping of the endpoints at both CE and PE side.  The endpoint at
      PE side should be elicited by some means by the NSC, in order to
      establish and set up the connectivity construct intended for the
      customer slice request, according to the SLOs and SLEs received
      from the higher level system.

        IETF concern

5.1.1.  Mapping EP_transport to IETF NS CE endpoints

   The 3GPP Management system provides the EP_Transport IOC to extend
   the slice awareness to the transport network.  The EP_Transport IOC
   contains parameters as IP address, additional identifiers (i.e., vlan
   tag, MPLS label, etc), and associated QoS profile.  This IOC is
   related to the endpoints of the 3GPP managed functions
   (EP_Application IOC).

   The information captured in the EP_Transport IOC (3GPP concern)
   should be translated into the CE related parameters (IETF concern).
   There will be cases where such translation is straightforward, as for
   instance, when the 3GPP managed functions run on monolithic, purpose-
   specific network elements, in the way that the IP address attribute
   from the EP_Transport IOC is the IP address of an interface of the
   network element.  In this case, the information on EP_Transport IOC
   can be directly passed to the IETF NSC through the NBI, even though
   some additional information could be yet required, not being defined
   yet on 3GPP specifications (e.g., the mask applicable to the IP
   address field on EP_Transport).





Geng, et al.            Expires January 12, 2023               [Page 22]

Internet-Dradraft-gcdrb-teas-5g-network-slice-application-00   July 2022


   However, there could be other cases where such a relationship is not
   straightforward.  This could be the case of virtualized 3GPP managed
   functions that could be instantiated on a general-purpose network
   element.  In these other cases it is necessary to define additional
   means for eliciting the endpoint at the CE side corresponding to the
   endpoint of the 3GPP-related function.

   With solely EP_Transport characterization in 3GPP, we could expect
   the NS CE endpoint being identified by a combination of IP address
   and some additional information such as vlan tag or SRv6 label that
   could discriminate against a certain logical interface.  The next hop
   router information is related to the next hop view from the
   perspective of the 3GPP entity part of the slice, then providing
   hints for determining the slice endpoint at the other side of the
   slice service.  Finally, the QoS profile helps to determine
   configurations needed at the PE side to respect the SLOs in the
   connection between CEs slice endpoints.

5.1.2.  Mapping IETF NS CE to PE endpoints

   As described in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], there are
   different potential endpoint positions for an IETF NS.

                  Figure 7: IETF Network Slice endpoints

   The information that is passed to the IETF NSC in terms of endpoints
   is the information relative to the CE position, which is the one



Geng, et al.            Expires January 12, 2023               [Page 23]

Internet-Dradraft-gcdrb-teas-5g-network-slice-application-00   July 2022


   known by the slice customer.  From that information, the NSC needs to
   infer the corresponding endpoint position at PE side, in order to
   setup the desired connectivity constructs with the SLOs indicated in
   the request.

   Being slice request technology-agnostic, the identification of the
   slice endpoints at the PE side should leverage on generic information
   passed through the NBI to the IETF NSC.

5.2.  5G E2E Network Slice Mapping in Control Plane

   There is no explicit interaction between transport network and AN/CN
   in the control plane, but the S-NSSAI defined in [TS23501] is treated
   as the end-to-end network slice identifier in the control plane of AN
   and CN, which is used in UE registration and PDU session setup.  In
   this draft, we assume that there is mapping relationship between
   S-NSSAI and NSI in the management plane, thus it could be mapped to a
   IETF network slice .

   Editor's note: The mapping relationship between NSI defined in
   [TS23501] and S-NSSAI defined in [TS23501] is still in discussion.

5.3.  5G E2E Network Slice Mapping in Data Plane

   If multiple network slices are carried through one physical interface
   between AN/CN and TN, IETF Network Slice Interworking ID in the data
   plane needs to be introduced.  If different network slices are
   transported through different physical interfaces, Network Slices
   could be distinguished by the interface directly.  Thus IETF Network
   Slice Interworking ID is not the only option for network slice
   mapping, while it may help in introducing new network slices.

5.3.1.  Data Plane Mapping Considerations

   The mapping relationship between AN or CN network slice identifier
   (either S-NSSAI in control plane or NSI/NSSI in management plane) and
   IETF Network Slice Interworking ID needs to be maintained in AN/CN
   network nodes, and the mapping relationship between IETF Network
   Slice Interworking ID and IETF Network Slice is maintained in the
   edge node of transport network.  When the packet of a uplink flow
   goes from AN to TN, the packet is encapsulated based on the IETF
   Network Slice Interworking ID; then the encapsulation of IETF Network
   Slice Interworking ID is read by the edge node of transport network,
   which maps the packet to the corresponding IETF network slice.

   Editor's Note: We have considered to add "Network Instance" defined
   in [TS23501]in the draft.  However, after the discussion with 3GPP
   people, we think the concept of "network instance" is a 'neither

   Necessary nor Sufficient Condition' for network slice.  Network
   Instance could be determined by S-NSSAI, it could also depends on
   other information; Network slice could also be allocated without
   network instance (in my understanding) And, IETF Network Slice
   Interworking ID is not a competitive concept with network
   instance.IETF Network Slice Interworking ID is a concept for the data
   plane interconnection with transport network, network instance may be
   used by AN and CN nodes to associate a network slice with IETF
   Network Slice Interworking ID

   The mapping between 3GPP slice and transport slice in user plane
   could happens in:

   (R)AN: User data goes from (radio) access network to transport
   network

   UPF: User data goes from core network functions to transport network

   Editor's Note: As figure 4.7.1. in [TS28530] describes, TN NS will
   not only exist between AN and CN but may also within AN NS and CN NS.
   However, here we just show the TN between AN and CN as an example to
   avoid unncessary complexity.

   The following picture shows the user plane protocol stack in end-to-
   end 5G system.

5.3.2.1.  Layer 3 and Layer 2 Encapsulations

   If the encapsulation above IP layer is not visible to Transport
   Network, it is not able to be used for network slice interworking
   with transport network.  In this case, IP header and Ethernet header
   could be considered to provide information of network slice
   interworking from AN or CN to TN.

   The following field in IP header and Ethernet header could be
   considered :

   IP Header:

   o  DSCP: It is traditionally used for the mapping of QoS identifier
      between AN/CN and TN network.  Although some values (e.g.  The
      unassigned code points) may be borrowed for the network slice
      interworking, it may cause confusion between QoS mapping and
      network slicing mapping.;

   o  Destination Address: It is possible to allocate different IP
      addresses for entities in different network slice, then the
      destination IP address could be used as the network slice
      interworking identifier.  However, it brings additional
      requirement to IP address planning.  In addition, in some cases
      some AN or CN network slices may use duplicated IP addresses.

   o  Option fields/headers: It requires that both AN and CN nodes can
      support the encapsulation and decapsulation of the options.

   Ethernet header

   o  VLAN ID: It is widely used for the interconnection between AN/CN
      nodes and the edge nodes of transport network for the access to
      different VPNs.  One possible problem is that the number of VLAN
      ID can be supported by AN nodes is typically limited, which
      effects the number of IETF network slices a AN node can attach to.
      Another problem is the total amount of VLAN ID (4K) may not
      provide a comparable space as the network slice identifiers of
      mobile networks.

   Two or more options described above may also be used together as the
   IETF Network Slice Interworking ID, while it would make the mapping
   relationship more complex to maintain.

   In some other case, when AN or CN could support more layer 3
   encapsulations, more options are available as follows:

   If the AN or CN could support MPLS, the protocol stack could be as
   follows:

   +------------------------+-----------
   | Application Protocols  |      ^
   +------------------------+      |
   |       IP (User)        |  Invisible

   |          IP            |
   +------------------------+
   |       Ethernet         |
   +------------------------+

   A specified MPLS label could be used to as a IETF Network Slice
   Interworking ID.

   If the AN or CN could support SRv6, the protocol stack is as follows:

   +------------------------+-----------
   | Application Protocols  |      ^

   |       IP (User)        |  Invisible

   The following field could be considered to identify a network slice:

   SRH:

   o  SRv6 functions: AN/CN is supposed to support the new function
      extension of SRv6.

   o  Optional TLV: AN/CN is supposed to support the extension of
      optional TLV of SRH.

5.3.2.2.  Above Layer 3 Encapsulations

   If the encapsulation above IP layer is visible to Transport Network,
   it is able to be used to identify a network slice.  In this case, UPD
   and GTP-U could be considered to provide information of network slice
   interworking between AN or CN and TN.

6.  Example of IETF Network Slice request through IETF Network Slice NBI

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], to fulfill IETF
   network slices and to perform monitoring on them, an entity called
   IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) is required to take abstract
   requests for IETF network slices and realize them using suitable
   underlying technologies.  An IETF Network Slice Controller is the key
   building block for control and management of the IETF network slice.
   It provides the creation/modification/deletion, monitoring and
   optimization of transport Slices in a multi-domain, a multi-
   technology and multi-vendor environment.

                  Figure 8: IETF Network Slice Controller NBI for 5G

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the main task of
   the IETF Network Slice Controller is to map abstract IETF network
   slice requirements from NBI to concrete technologies on SBI and
   establish the required connectivity, and ensure that required
   resources are allocated to IETF network slice.  There are a number of
   different technologies that can be used on SBI including physical
   connections, MPLS, TSN, Flex-E, PON etc.  If the undelay technology
   is IP/MPLS/Optics, any IETF models can be used during the realization
   of IETF network slice.

   There are no specific mapping requirements for 5G.  The only
   difference is that in case of 5G, the NBI interface contains
   additional 5G specific attributes such as customer name, mobile
   service type, 5G E2E network slice ID (i.e.  S-NSSAI) and so on (See
   Section 6).  These 5G specific attributes can be employed by IETF
   Network Slice Controller during the realization of 5G IETF network
   slices on how to map NBI to SBI.  They can also be used for assurance
   of 5G IETF network slices.  Figure 9 shows the mapping between NBI to
   SBI for 5G IETF network slices.

7.  Gap Analysis

   The way in which 3GPP is characterizing the slice endpoint (i.e.,
   EP_Transport) is based on Layer 3 information (e.g., the IP Address).
   However the information provided seems not to be sufficient for
   instructing the IETF Network Slice Controller for the realization of
   the IETF NEtwork Slice.  For instance, some basic information such as
   the mask associated to the IP address of the EP_Transport is not
   specified, as well as other kind of parameters like the connection
   MTU or the connectivity type (unicast, multicast, etc).  More
   sophisticated information could be required as well, like the level
   of isolation or protection necessary for the intended slice.

   In the case in which the 3GPP managed function runs on a purpose-
   specific network element, the IP address specified in the
   EP_Transport IOC serves as reference to identify the CE endpoint,
   assuming the endpoint of the CE has been configured with that IP
   address.  With that information (together with the logical interface
   ID) should be sufficient for the IETF NSC to identify the counterpart
   endpoint at the PE side, and configuring it accordingly (e.g., with a
   compatible IP address) for setting up the slice end-to-end.
   Similarly, the next hop information in EP_Transport can help validate
   the end-to-end slice between PE endpoints.





Geng, et al.            Expires January 12, 2023               [Page 31]

Internet-Dradraft-gcdrb-teas-5g-network-slice-application-00   July 2022


   In the case in which the 3GPP managed function is instantiated as a
   virtualized network function, the direct association between the IP
   address of EP_Transport and the actual endpoint mapped at the CE is
   not so clear.  It could be the case, for instance when the
   virtualized network function is instantiated at the internal of a
   data center, that the CE facing the PE is far from the point where
   the function is deployed, being that connectivity extended through
   the internals of the data center (or by some internal configuration
   of a virtual switch in a server).  In these situations additional
   information is needed for accomplishing the end-to-end connection.

   At the same time, [TS28.541] IOC contains useful parameters to be
   used in IETF Network Slice creation mechanism and enreaching IETF
   Network Slice model.  The following parameters may be suggested as a
   candidates to the correlation of the IETF Network Slice parameters
   and IETF Network Slice model enreachments:

   o  For the latency, dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet,
      reliability and delayTolerance attributes, the following NRM apply
      (with reference to the section in that specification):

   o

      *  CNSliceSubnetProfile (section 6.3.22 in [TS28.541])

      *  RANSliceSubnetProfile (section 6.3.23 in [TS28.541])

      *  TopSliceSubnetProfile (section 6.3.24 in [TS28.541])

   o  For the qosProfile attribute, the NRM which applies is
      EP_Transport (detailed in section 6.3.17 in [TS28.541])
