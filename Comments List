Thread: [Teas] Applicability of IETF network slices in the 3GPP context

2022-05-25 [Chairs:Pavan and Lou]

We (the chairs) acknowledge that it is important for the WG to work on a
document that discusses the applicability of IETF network slices in the
3GPP context.

We have had 3 documents presented in past TEAS sessions that can form the
basis of such a document:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-contreras-teas-3gpp-ietf-slice-mapping/
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-geng-teas-network-slice-mapping
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-rokui-5g-ietf-network-slice/

We encourage the authors of these documents to find ways to collaborate and
produce a single document (ideally before IETF114) that the WG can look to
adopt.

BTW, although its scope is not only 3GPP network slice, the following
document may be help to understand the architecture of 3GPP user plane and
its requirements including network slicing.

I think we have complementary parts which are worthy to put together. On one hand there are 
generic architectural aspects that can show how 3GPP systems will act as upper systems of IETF NSC. 
There are also aspects on how 3GPP expects (as today) to requests slices at TN (in 3GPP terminology), 
which could show limitations (or undefined terms) on some of the required capabilities at the 
connectivity slices. And finally there are potential realizations today that could be documented.

The task is huge, anyway, so we need to analyze what can be delivered for IETF114, maybe an structure 
of the merged content, hopefully something else. In any case, definitely worthy to work on it.

Document merge proposal
There are 3 documents in TEAS about this topic with slightly different side focus:

-        draft-geng-teas-network-slice-mapping provides a procedure of mapping 5G end-to-end network defined in 5GPP slice to transport network slice defined in IETF, which gives guidance about how to use IETF network slice in 5G scenario in management plane, control plane and data plane respectively.

-        draft-contreras-teas-3gpp-ietf-slice-mapping discusses mapping of 3GPP slice and IETF network slice endpoint and other related parameters, which mainly focuses about how to provide connection between 3GPP connection by IETF Network Slice with NSC

-        draft-rokui-5g-ietf-network-slice discusses the relationship between 5G E2E network slicing and IETF network slice for 5G use-case, which also gives 5G IETF Network Slice NBI Information Model

Here is an initial proposal about the structure for combining these 3 documents:

-  Is any special identifier, which is IETF-nodes aware (e.g., SID in an
IPv6 extension header, MPLS label, NSH, etc.), is needed for classification
on IETF NS PE? As you know, packets on N3 and N9 interfaces are
encapsulated  with GTP-U, and traffic assigned to different network slices
may have the same src/dst IP addresses. If we use some special identifier,
a standardized scheme for that would be needed, especially for
multi-administrative domains environment. Or, 3GPP 5G system is required to
deploy an interface or a UPF instance for each network slice?

- Are there any differences between procedures of mapping/stitching
3GPP-IETF network slices at RAN, 5G-Core, and DN (i.e., N3, N6, and N9
interfaces) ? (For example, information exchanged between IETF NSC and 5G
OpS, or classification scheme.) 5G has MEC scenarios and guaranteed
communication quality may be required in DN. On N6 packets are passed as
user-plane PDU, and network slices run on DN may be required to support
ethernet and unstructured forms, in addition to IPv4/v6 (ref TS23 501).
Also, 5G allows multiple access, and we may need to consider cases where
IETF network slices deployed on a fixed network (this is not TN within RAN)
connected to a 5G-core.
